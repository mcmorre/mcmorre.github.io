Hi! I'm a graduate student at NYU physics. I enjoy saying simple things about hard problems. But sometimes it's necessary to resort to the complicated answer!

You can find my publications here and my CV [here](./_cv/cv.html).

Below is an overview of some of the topics I've thought about.

# Emergent activity


# The Dynamic Latent Variable Model


# Other thoughts

[Thoughts on nonreciprocal forces](./aug-19-24.html)
