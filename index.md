Hi! I'm a graduate student at NYU physics. I enjoy saying simple things about hard problems. But sometimes it's necessary to resort to the complicated answer!

You can find my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=ALUCkoXSqLiTMH4c-FjLktiIgAp_6KPM1j_hSbOuxuOfHWQoddZlfqSHF72m3EkA6DuyW7PUXVzvS3z1oMb-OAbEHYpF&user=ArLaWlsAAAAJ) and my CV [here](./cv.html).

Below is an overview of some of the topics I've thought about.

# Emergent activity


# The Dynamic Latent Variable Model


# Other thoughts

[Thoughts on nonreciprocal forces](./aug-19-24.html)
