Hi! I'm a graduate student at NYU physics. I enjoy studying complex systems with a theoretical and computational tools. I'm especially interested in the dynamics of systems driven by external processes. During my exploration of complex systems, I have explained statistical signatures in large populations of neurons, and ... Read more about these projects below!
